There are many ways to participate in proof-of-stake (PoS) on Ethereum. A great resource newcomers is the [getting started post](https://reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/jjdxvw/welcome_to_rethstaker_the_home_for_ethereum/) on [/r/ethstaker](https://reddit.com/r/ethstaker/). If you prefer video-based content, Superphiz's [Intro to Eth2 & Staking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkpW031RCI) ETHGlobal presentation is an excellent starting point.
