No â€” as it will functionally cease to exist. When "The Merge" occurs the entire Eth 1.0 proof-of-work (PoW) chain _becomes_ the state of the Eth 2.0 proof-of-stake (PoS) chain.

If any nodes were to continue mining via PoW on Eth 1.0 the economic value of their block rewards would be far below their cost of operation. Because miners are incentivized to operate at a profit it is expect that Eth 1.0 PoW participants will immediately begin to mine with their hardware on other non-Ethereum PoW blockchains.
