**If you are interested in helping with "The Merge":** See [Rayonism](https://rayonism.io/) for in depth details on how to help contribute.

**If you are a dapp developer:** Consider deploying your dapp on the testnet during the [ETHGlobal Scaling Ethereum hackathon](https://scaling.ethglobal.co/) (April 16 - May 14). The more the merrier!

**If you are a L2 developer or a protocol developer who would like to help with the merge process:** introduce yourself in the [Eth R&D discord](https://discord.gg/BGuQfYwmVD).

**If you are an Ethereum user:** Be on the lookout for announcements from your favorite dapps that will be deploying on the upcoming testnet. Help your favorite developers kick the tires and shake out the bugs by using their dapps within the safety of a test environment.
