Ethereum in its current state is using [proof-of-work (PoW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EUAcxhuoU4) to ensure consensus amongst the thousands of nodes in the network. While PoW is reliable and secure, it is also _extremely_ energy intensive. To produce each block on the network participants are required to use powerful and energy-hungry GPUs to solve a complex mathematical problem.

Alternatively, [proof-of-stake (PoS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psKDXvXdr7k) guarantees the security of the network in a different way. In PoS, anyone with 32 ETH can _deposit_ that ETH to become a _validator_, a node that participates in the network's consensus algorithm. Finalizing a block requires 2/3 of all active validators to sign off on it. Should a malicious actor try to tamper with the underlying protocol by using a large number of validators to revert a finalized block (the equivalent of a "51% attack" in PoW) their funds are slashed â€” meaning they lose a portion of their staked ETH. This makes attacks extremely expensive; it would be like a PoW system where if you use your mining hardware to attack the network then your hardware catches fire and is destroyed.

PoS does not require the same energy-intensive hardware as PoW. Any relatively recent consumer hardware should be capable of running the software required to operate a 32 ETH staking node. If you deposit more than 32 ETH, you will be assigned multiple "validator slots" by the protocol, but you will still be able to run them from a single computer, though hardware requirements go up the more you stake. Most estimates put the expected energy savings from the switch to PoS to be around 99%.
