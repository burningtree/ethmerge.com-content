There are always risks when making a large change to a protocol that is securing [hundreds of billions of dollars of assets](https://etherscan.io/stat/supply). "The Merge" can be thought of as replacing the engine of an airplane while it is still flying. Thankfully, the beacon chain â€” the current proof-of-stake (PoS) Ethereum chain - has been running since December 2020 without issues.

There are currently 4 unique client implementations PoS Ethereum nodes. This means that if a PoS node operator experiences issues with a given implementation they will have the ability to switch to different client. The currently PoS network is the result of years of research and hard work. Participants can rest assured that before "The Merge" occurs the code in use will have been exhaustively checked, battle tested, and checked again.
