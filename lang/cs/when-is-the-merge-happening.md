**Short Answer:**<br> The best current (non-official) estimate is sometime in Q1 2022.

**Long Answer:**<br> At the time of writing there is no definitive date for "The Merge".

The Eth 1.0 proof-of-work (PoW) chain will undergo 2 hard forks named [Berlin and London](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/acd-update-001) in 2021. Afterwards the Ethereum community is pushing for all effort to be focused on the switch to Eth 2.0 proof-of-stake (PoS).

The Eth 2.0 PoS chain is currently running and will undergo its first hard fork (Codenamed Altair) in June 2021 - before "The Merge".

Between April 16th and May 14th 2021 ETHGlobal will be hosting the [Ethereum virtual scaling Hackaton](https://scaling.ethglobal.co). The Eth1-Eth2 merge is one of the [projects](https://rayonism.io/) which will be worked on during the hackathon.

Depending on the result of the prototypes being built during the ETHGlobal Hackathon and the first results of the first Eth 2.0 PoS hard fork, a [decision will be made](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/acd-update-001) (in June 2021) on whether or not the Eth 1.0 PoW "Shanghai" hard fork will focus on Eth 1.0 [Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)](https://eips.ethereum.org/) or if "The Merge" will become the top priority. The Shanghai hard fork is currently expected to take place in Q1 2022.
