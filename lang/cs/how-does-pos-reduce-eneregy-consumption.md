In proof-of-work (PoW) whoever solves the block first gets the reward. Simply put, PoW is a race. If you have more hash rate than your competitors you are more likely to win. The end result of this arms race is that PoW miners run as many GPUs as they can at 100% load, 24-hours-a-day. This extreme power demand [continues to grow](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/bitcoin-energy-use-mined-the-gap) with the price of the block rewards they are attempting to earn.

Alternatively, in proof-of-stake (PoS) block proposers are [randomly selected](https://benjaminion.xyz/eth2-annotated-spec/phase0/beacon-chain/#compute_proposer_index) — completely removing the requirement for an arms race. There is no way to increase the likelihood that any specific node is chosen to propose a block — so there is no need to consume more and more energy to improve your competitive chances.

Because PoS nodes are estimated to be [99%](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/ethereum-plans-to-cut-its-absurd-energy-consumption-by-99-percent) (or [more](https://twitter.com/sigp_io/status/1374979655782989824)) more efficient their PoW counterparts, PoS represents a massive leap forward for the energy efficiency of blockchain technology.
